# a few osascripts
A couple of simple osascripts and automator workflows for MacOS that make my life simpler sometimes.
### vim-editor.app
A simple Automator workflow that opens files in VIM editor in a new window of the Terminal.app.
### dark-mode-switch.scpt(.app)
A simple osa-script and an app that changes between dark and light mode of the MacOS.
### workflows
- `creation-date.workflow` expands to a markdown code expression: `Created: DD Mon YEAR`.
- `folder-lowercase-dasher.workflow` renames the selected folders and files to be lowercase and contain dahses instad of underscores and spaces.
## Installation
A terminal command `open filename` on macos will prompt the addition of the workflows to the system.
